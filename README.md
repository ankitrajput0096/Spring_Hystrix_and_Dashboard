# Server Side Load Balancing and Routing using Spring Cloud API Gateway and Eureka

Dockerized Spring Boot application for Server side load balancing and routing using Spring Cloud API Gateway and Eureka.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See running for notes on how to run the project on a system.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the project to your local environment:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ankitrajput0096/SpringCloud_API_Gateway_with_Eureka
    ```

2. You need Docker to be installed:

    #### Windows:
    https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe
    
    #### Mac:
    https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg
    
    #### Ubuntu:
    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

### Installing

Once you have docker installed on your environment, install the project dependencies via:

Build docker Image:

```
docker-compose build
```

## Running

Start docker:

```
docker-compose up
```
Or


Start docker with scaled up services:

```
docker-compose up --scale clientone=3 --scale clienttwo=3

```
### NOTE:
Can scale up clientone and clienttwo services to max instances of 5.
If you want to scale even higher, then increase the port range in `docker-compose` file.

Your Spring Cloud API Gateway server should be now running on http://localhost:8000, ClientOne server should be now running on http://localhost:8080-8085 and ClientTwo server should be now running on http://localhost:8086-90 and Eureka server cluster should be now running on http://localhost:9001, http://localhost:9002, http://localhost:9003 

## Get an access to all exposed API's with Postman

1. Install Postman (https://www.getpostman.com)
2. Import Postman collection from the `SpringCloud_API_Gateway_Eureka_SpringBoot.postman_collection.json` file
3. Enjoy !!

#### NOTE : To see server side load balancing observe terminal logs of `docker-compose`. When trying to hit same endpoint multiple times parallely.
